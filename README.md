# square_pattern

This is a mini exercise from the 42 school's Piscine (rush00) that prompts the user to input the length and width of the specified square pattern they want. This exercise acts as a introduction to receiving inputs from the command line and how to really make a program.

## How to use:
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rsoo23/square_pattern.git square
```
2. Make the executable
```bash
make
```
3. Input the arguments
```bash
./square [rush number] [length] [width]
```
```
Rush number: 0 to 4 
Length: 0 to INT_MAX 
Width: 0 to INT_MAX
```
